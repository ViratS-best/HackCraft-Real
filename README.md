# Soul Swap

A simple Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.11 that changes how Ender Pearls work when you hit mobs. Instead of just teleporting you, it swaps your soul with theirs.

## Features

* **The Swap**: Throw a pearl at any mob and you'll swap positions instantly. Great for getting out of a bad spot or messing with friends.
* **Hostile Confusion**: If you swap with a monster (Zombie, Creeper, etc), they take 4 damage (2 hearts) and get hit with a quick Nausea effect because they're confused.
* **Stealth Escape**: If you swap with a passive animal (like a Pig or Cow), you get 3 seconds of Invisibility. Perfect for a quick get-away.

Includes custom portal and soul fire particles + sounds to make the swap feel smooth.
